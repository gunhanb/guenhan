      <description>We all know that drugs are used as treatments for diseases, right? But did you think about how, scientifically, it is shown that drugs actually benefits and but not harms? Before my biostats education, I was naively imagining that since we know what causes the disease and which part of the body it affects etc., scientist are producing chemicals to cure the diseases. But, of course, this was so naive and human body is so complicated, and mostly we don’t know even the causes of the diseases.</description>
