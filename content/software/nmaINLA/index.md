nmaINLA is an R package for Bayesian network meta-analysis using integrated nested Laplace approximations ('INLA') which is described in Guenhan, Held, and Friede (2018) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1285>. Includes methods to assess the heterogeneity and inconsistency in the network. Contains more than ten different network meta-analysis data. 'INLA' package can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. We recommend the testing version
