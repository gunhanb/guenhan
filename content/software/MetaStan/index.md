MetaStan is an R package for Bayesian meta-analysis via 'Stan'. Performs Bayesian meta-analysis and model-based meta-analysis using 'Stan'. Includes binomial-normal hierarchical models and option to use weakly informative priors for the heterogeneity parameter and the treatment effect parameter which are described in Guenhan, Roever, and Friede (2020) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1370>.
