abstract = "Model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) is a generalization of the ``standard'' meta-analysis in which dosing information from different studies is taken into account. MBMA has become an increasingly important aspect of drug development to inform study design and decision-making. A Bayesian approach to fit generalized linear mixed models for the purpose of conducting MBMA is very attractive. The aim of MBMA is estimating the dose-response relationship (e.g. Emax or logistic) by taking into account possible between-trial heterogeneity in the shapes of the dose-response curves. At present, model-based meta-analyses are commonly based on a contrast-based model, which focuses on estimating relative treatment effects in comparison to a references dose such as placebo, and does not account appropriately for the variability in the estimates of the reference dose which is crucial for the estimation of the dose-response function. Inspired by the network meta-analysis literature, we suggest the use of an arm-based model to fit MBMA models, in which absolute treatment effects are estimated. We illustrate the proposed arm-based model, and compare it with the contrast-based model using a meta-analysis of a binary endpoint in migraine pain relief. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the operating characteristics of the arm-based and contrast-based models under different scenarios. Bayesian implementations of the arm-based and contrast-based MBMA models will be included in our publicly available R package MetaStan (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MetaStan)."
