abstract = "This thesis investigates how to perform inference with different approaches in meta- analysis models as well as in regression-type meta-analysis models named meta-regression. Chapter 1 contains an introduction to meta-analysis as well as different statistical models and estimation techniques for meta-analysis. Also, a recent Bayesian inference method named integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) is used for making estimations in meta-analysis. Chapter 2 contains a motivation for a broader type of meta-analysis called network meta-analysis (NMA). This chapter introduces two models, namely the Lumley and the Lu-Ades models, for NMA and shows how INLA apply to those models. Chapter 3 starts with the discussion of the distinction for different types of inconsistency in the network, namely the cycle inconsistency and the design inconsistency. Then, the design-by-interaction model using random inconsistency parameters, the Jackson model, is introduced. This chapter continues with showing how INLA can be used as an infer- ence method for the Jackson model. Also, Chapter 3 shows that the Lu-Ades models depend on the treatment ordering while the Jackson model do not for an application. All analysis was performed in the R programming language (R Core Team, 2015). Three different applications were used to demonstrate the use of INLA and other methods. Ap- pendix includes the R-code which are used to obtain the results in the main text and the BUGS/JAGS-code to fit the consistency and the Jackson model with MCMC. Also, an R function, meta.inla, which is developed to implement the models introduced in Chapter 1 with INLA is given."
